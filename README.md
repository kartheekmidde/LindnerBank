A banking web application

A banking web application in which the parents can create/delete accounts for their children and make transactions for them. The child can withdraw from the account and can also generate the wish-list items. Reports are also generated based on the transactions and the wish-list items for each account separately. 

The front end of the application was designed using Bootstrap, HTML/CSS. .Net Framework (MVC) was used to design the accounts, transactions, wish list items and the controls, roles in the application.
